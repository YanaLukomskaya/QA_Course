1) pwd - shows the path to your location on the system;

2) mkdir - creates a folder in the current directory.

If you want to create a folder in a different directory, you need to write the path where the new folder will be created before the folder name (mkdir /D/Folder).

To create several folders at once, add folder names separated by spaces (mkdir NewFolder1 NewFolder2 NewFolder3);

3) cd - used to move from one directory to another. 

cd . - moves up one level;

4) touch - this command can be used to create files of different formats (json, txt, htm). With this command you can create several files at once.
File names must be separated by spaces;

5) ls - displays the contents of a folder. This command has many different options. With the -a option, you can view hidden files in the specified directory;

6) vim, nano - these are text terminal editors, you can use them to open and edit files;

7) mv - move command (mv file /home/user/tmp/). Interestingly, this command is also used for renaming (mv OldName NewName, the name is changed to NewName);

8) cp - command to copy;

9) find - command finds file;

10) tail - command outputs the last 10 lines of the file. Additionally, the operation of the command can be configured using options;

11) head - by default, it outputs the first 10 lines of the file. It can also be configured with additional options;

12) less - it can be used to open long files;

13) date - displays date and time;

14) curl - we can use this command to send an http-request to the server;

15) to write a script, you should first create a text file.  The script is saved in .sh format. The first line should indicate the shell,
through which the script will be executed. For example:

#!/bin/bash

mkdir folder1 folder2 folder3

cd folder1

touch 1.txt 2.txt 3.txt 1.json 2.json

mkdir f1 f2 f3

mv 1.txt 2.txt f1
